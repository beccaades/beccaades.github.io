    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There she goes. Again.</p>


<p></p>

<p><font color="red">#Shocking </font></p>


<p></p>

<p>It's always MY fault.  Like there's some sort of magic fairy dust sprinkled on <em>everyone else's</em> computer except *hers*. She even got an instructor to help her this time. Wow.  They are going to be in for a tasty treat--look what she put in!</p>


<pre><code class="ruby">evil_pokemons.each do
Pretty Please scrape the pokemons for me!!!!!
end
</code></pre>

<p>Please. Tell me she's joking.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Oh Wait, Shhhh. This is going to be good! She was just asked if she read the Nokogiri tutorial.  SAY WHAT???? <em>She DID</em>?  She was on that website for .56 seconds.  #FACTS. <em><strong>(PLEASE!!! JUST OPEN MY PAGES AND I WILL SPILL ALL! NO SNITCHES GET STICHES FOR ME!!!)</strong></em>.</p>




<p>Deep breaths. Let's turn on this fan. Look, I mean, had she read it, she would've seen it's all really quite simple. You just give me a few, quick, straightforward commands at the top of your page, and I make like a shepherd and flock!</p>


<pre><code class="ruby">require 'nokogiri'
require 'open-uri'
</code></pre>

<p>You can even put these commands into irb to play around with, and I will set up your ENTIRE environment perfectly (just make sure I return "true" after each command).</p>


<p></p>

<P> Next, kindly let me know what language you would like to use (I'm <em>very</em> versatile), and for heaven's sake don't be lazy, name your document something fun--'doc' is just so uneventful.</p>


<pre><code class="ruby">html = open('website').read
doc_name = Nokogiri::HTML(html)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you are at the part where you get to chillax.  Open up your browser by right clicking in crome on inspect element, and you should be able to use the nifty magnifying glass to help you locate any element's css selector you would like on the page.</p>




<p>Once you've found the css selector of your desired element-try it out-I mean, you wouldn't buy a car without test driving it first, why should scraping be <em>any different</em>? Feel free to use binding.pry, a simple puts command, or the beautiful world of irb!</p>


<pre><code class="ruby">variable_doc.search(" ").text
variable_doc.css(" ").text
</code></pre>

<p>.search and .css mean the same thing, so don't cry your pretty little eyes out about that!  Once you've successfully matched the css selector to your element you are good to go and can head right back to your ruby program. Adding .text at the end returns--you guessed it--the text that your css selector selected!  I will take care of all the rest (like I ALWAYS do ðŸ˜˜).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  You woke up one day and realized you were ready to try something new.  Do something different.  You had taught for nine years: three countries, five schools, all ages, and (luckily!) you loved it.  You were absolutely happy.  You loved the purpose it gave you. The connections you made. The unbridled energy of Every. Single. Day.  You were never bored.  Never.</p>

<p>  Until one day, it just didnâ€™t work anymore. And you werenâ€™t sure exactly why. You wished you had the answer, because then, maybe, you could have fixed it. It became harder and harder to keep at something, when the spark was gone.  Maybe it was all the testing.  Maybe it was the lack of services. Maybe it was the bureaucracy.  You canâ€™t quite say&hellip;but it was time for something new.</p>

<p>  You remember hearing that the average person switches their career 7 times, and here you were 31, and still doing the same thing?  Maybe it was all just an expiration date after all!  You remember learning about Steph, how she went to Flatiron, and was now working full time.  Wait.  You said.  She just went to school for three months and now has a job? Yes. WAIT.  For reals? AND she LOVES it.</p>

<p>  You talked to people.  One girl had left an office job for a start up.  Her biggest regret was that her employers didnâ€™t fire her so she could collect unemployment.  She told you to begin at codeacademy.  You did.  You felt like you were back in fifth grade when every morning began with a multiplication times tables.  Every student had 1 minute complete the questions, and if you got them all right, you got a sticker, and the next day you moved on to the next number.   You loved the certificates.  The emails congratulating you.  And you loved coding!</p>

<p>  You took a class, you applied to some programs, you coded, and miraculously, you got into Flatiron!  You were so happy(cartwheels(!) and cartwheels(!))!  You had a new future.  Something exciting. Bright. And last week, you began.  You coded all week.  You learned how much you didnâ€™t know.  You got help.  You stayed up too late, and finally, you managed to answer some of your own questions.  The error messages slowly made a little more sense.  And thatâ€™s where you are.  At the beginning.</p>

<p>  I lied.</p>

<p>  I said one day I woke up and wanted to try something new.  It didnâ€™t happen like that.  It was a process.</p>

<p>  There is no ready. set. go.  Itâ€™s not a gunshot and then you go off running into the distance like an antelope tearing up a glorious African sunset.  Itâ€™s a Sunday long run, slow footstep after slow footstep, building up the miles, so that one day, when that shot is fired, you will at the absolute least, know you prepared the very best you could.</p>
